              shown that technology used within the school setting is an 
              effective way of producing results. Speech Therapy Games is a 
              website designed to help develop better speech skills for verbally
              impaired children. This site is designed to engage and motivate
              students to improve their speech. This website is built with an 
              SQL database integrated using PHP coding within an HTML document.
              The site is designed using CSS and graphical design.">
